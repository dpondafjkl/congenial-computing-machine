When you inevitably look up good schools to attend in Houston, you’ll come across several, and one of them will inevitably and unfortunately be St. John’s School (2401 Claremont Lane).

Let me ask you this. Do you want your child to suffer from excessive overcompetition? Low self-esteem? And overall broken sense of self and warped view of others? Look no further than to send your kid to this horrendous institution.

The administration actively enables this hyper-competition with no regard for the students. Because why? It’s in their own best interest. They gather the best and brightest to pit them against each other to get the best test scores and the best college placements.

Rest assured, there’s no regard for the student’s well being or fostering a collaborative and conducive environment to learning.

I’m a fellow graduate and most of the people that I graduated with were very bitter about their experience. The most ironic thing is that their college placements aren’t that much better than other private schools.

I’ve encountered people from other schools within our athletic conference and their perception was that we were the most hypercompetitive and toxic. So let me ask you this do you want your child to suffer? If not, take this article seriously.

There is immense evil within the institution. Take caution.
